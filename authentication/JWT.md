**JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

- **Authorization**: Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
- **Information Exchange**: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are.

## What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

`xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

**Header**

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Payload**

The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

- **Registered claims**: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: **iss** (issuer), **exp** (expiration time), **sub** (subject), **aud** (audience), and others.
- **Public claims**: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs.
- **Private claims**: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.

An example payload could be:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

The payload is then **Base64Url** encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.

**Signature**

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

## How does JSON Web Tokens work?

In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required.

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the **Authorization** header using the **Bearer** schema. The content of the header should look like the following:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for certain operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case.

If the token is sent in the `Authorization` header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.
